        <h3>Web Developer</h3>
        <p>I am an enthusiastic and committed web developer, deeply rooted in the craft of building dynamic and user-centric websites and applications. My journey in web development is driven by a profound attention to detail and an unwavering dedication to writing clean, efficient code. I have been on a continuous path of learning and growth. Initially captivated by the endless possibilities of the digital world, I started by learning the basics of HTML and CSS, and JavaScript and will be learning more. My curiosity and drive to create comprehensive solutions led me to explore more technologies,that I hope in coming days I will be a well-rounded developer capable of handling the full stack of web development.
